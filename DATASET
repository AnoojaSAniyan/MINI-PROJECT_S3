The data used for analysis is a database that contains posts by reddit users corresponding to different personality types. The database can be accessed on kaggle. 
This is a free, open source, public domain dataset. We will create a personality finder application where a user can enter any set of words that describes themselves.
The application will run the compute a similarity score of the user entered text with the various entries from the personality type database to predict the personality type (one of 16 Myers Briggs personalities). 
It will also predict the likelihood of the four Myers Briggs characteristics such as Introverted/Extraverted, Intuitive/Observant, Thinking/Feeling and Judging Judging/Perceiving.
The application will show the top 5 predictions with the similarity scores so the user knows a spectrum of personalities that fit her or him.
